  <title>Grading</title>
  <p>
    Your grade is determined by hitting thresholds in three different categories:
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Reading</title>
        <p>For each book section you will have to submit a <em>reading record</em> and fill out a brief <em>online quiz</em>, both due the night before the topic is to be discussed in class. The reading records are to be submitted in Canvas, and each should be a 2 minutes-or-shorter recording where you discuss 3 key things you learned and 1-2 questions you have. The quiz will also be available from Canvas and linking back to questions in this book.</p>
        <p>
          These are both evaluated on "completion": As long as you submitted something and answers the quiz questions, you get a completion for that day. The percent of completed readings is one factor in your final grade.
        </p>
      </li>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>There will be three exams to assess your level of understanding of the theoretical concepts. The first exam covers virtualization, the second deals with concurrency and the third with persistence.</p>
        <p>Each exam will have 4 questions. If your answer to a question is considered sufficiently correct and thorough, that question is considered completed. The number of completed questions by the end of the term is a factor in your final grade.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Projects</title>
        <p>There will be a total of 10 projects, requiring you to understand and modify the code of a small operating system. These have due dates. On a particular week you can either turn in the project due that week or one project from a previous week, but you can only submit one project on any particular week. Note however that there are some weeks without a new project, which is an opportunity to catch up on a project you had fallen behind on.</p>
        <p>If a project submission is considered sufficiently thorough and correct, the project is considered completed. The number of completed projects contributes to your final grade.</p>
      </li>
    </dl>
  </p>
  <p>
    These elements all come together to form a final grade: The highest row on this table where you hit all objectives determines your grade.
