  <title>Course objectives</title>
  <p>By the end of this course, a student should be able to:
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>P1: Processes</title>
        <p>
          Explain the mechanisms that an operating system utilizes to allow multiple processes to be run on a limited number of CPUs
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>P2: Scheduling</title>
        <p>
          Describe and contrast the policies that the operating system might employ for scheduling processes to run
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>M1: Virtual Memory</title>
        <p>
          Explain the mechanisms employed by the operating system in order to virtualize the physical memory so that processes don't need to know anything about the physical layout of their memory.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>M2: Page swapping</title>
        <p>
          Explain the mechanisms and policies involved in using persistent storage to provide the illusion that there is more available memory than there actually is.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>C1: Threads</title>
        <p>
          Describe how threads allow a process to have multiple threads of computation concurrently, and the challenges that this brings up.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>C2: Concurrency primitives</title>
        <p>
          Describe the core mechanisms used for implementing concurrency (locks, condition variables, semaphores).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>P1: Files</title>
        <p>
          Describe the main mechanisms and policies involved in the file abstraction and persisting information to a persistent storage medium.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>P2: Journaling</title>
        <p>
          Describe the journaling and log-based system mechanisms that ensure a file system can recover from something like a power outage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>I1: Code comprehension</title>
        <p>
          Examine the code of a small operating system, and identify how the various OS concepts are implemented.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>I2: Code modification</title>
        <p>
          Make suitable modifications to the small OS code in order to implement new features.
        </p>
      </li>
    </dl>
