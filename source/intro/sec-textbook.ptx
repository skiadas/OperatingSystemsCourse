  <p>The book we will be using is <url href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</url>, typically abbreviated as <abbr>OSTEP</abbr>. You may buy a physical copy of it if you would like, or directly access the PDF chapters online. These notes will use links to the PDF chapters online.</p>
  <p>
    We will also be using a secondary resource, a book describing the mini operating system we will be working with. You can find that book at <url href="https://xv6-guide.github.io/xv6-riscv-book/" />.
