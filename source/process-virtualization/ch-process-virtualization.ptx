  <title>Process Virtualization</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>We start our discussion with the process virtualization part. We will look at how the OS and the hardware can allow multiple processes to run seemingly concurrently. We will see
      <ul>
        <li>how process instructions are executed,</li>
        <li>how a process can be interrupted,</li>
        <li>how a switch to another process happens, and</li>
        <li>how the OS schedules which process to run next.</li>
      </ul>
      This will be the first two weeks of the course. Let's begin.</p>
